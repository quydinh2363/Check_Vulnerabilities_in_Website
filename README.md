# Welcome to my Repository - Check vulnerabilities in website project

# Vulnerabilities scanner in website

This project is written by Python, i am trying to test some vulnerabilities about SQL injection, XSS, CRSF.

## Features

- SQL Injection Scanner: Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities using a list of predefined payloads.
- XSS Scanner: Identifies XSS vulnerabilities with various payloads designed to execute JavaScript in the browser.
- CSRF Scanner: Checks for CSRF vulnerabilities by sending crafted POST requests with payloads.

## You will find in this repo:

* scanner.py is a code file.
* SQLInjection is a best version for checking SQL injection.
* SQLINJECTION.txt, XSS.txt are some injections.
* CSRF: Multiple CSRF payloads are predefined in the script.

## Notes:

* This script is intended for educational and testing purposes only, errors may occur.
* I have some problems testing XSS and CSRF. I will try to update as soon as possible!. Please forgive this omission
* Use responsibly and with permission on web applications you are authorized to test.
